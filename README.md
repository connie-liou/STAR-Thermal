# STAR-Thermal
A tool designed for nodal thermal analysis for CubeSats developed by students at Rutgers STAR

This tool is heavily based off of the SatTherm Tool designed at NASA AMES, which can be found here: https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2009/all2009/45/. We utilize Dash by Plotly to integrate all of the features for thermal analysis, tailored to CubeSat designs in LEO.
